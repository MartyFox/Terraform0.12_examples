# Terraform =>0.12 examples

This repo contains examples of built in Terraform functions and complex structures available in newer versions of Terraform.

As with all Terraform functions and structures they can be interpreted differently amongst different people and these are 
some of the use cases I've created as I've been using TF 0.13.

Make sure to visit the Terraform documentation on built in functions for more functions and examples:
